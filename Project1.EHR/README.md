### Predict HIV Progression

According to the World Health Organization, HIV has caused 25 millions deaths worldwide since it was first recognized in 1981. In recent years, the infection has been managed with a collection of therapies. However, the virus will likely evolve around these drugs, making it crucially important that we get a better understanding of the virus itself. An important step in understanding the virus, is to get a handle on its genetic blueprint. This competition aims to do this by having contestants find markers in the HIV sequence which predict a change in the severity of the infection (as measured by viral load and CD4 counts).
